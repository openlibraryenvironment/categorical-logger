# Change history for categorical-logger

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/openlibraryenvironment/categorical-logger/tree/v1.0.0) (2019-02-06)
[No changelog]

* Identical to `@folio/stripes-logger` v1.0.0. All that has happened is that it's been moved out of FOLIO's GitHub space into the Open Library Environment's, and now publishes to the main NPM registry as `categorical-logger` (with no namespace) rather than to the FOLIO NPM registry as `@folio/stripes-logger`.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-logger/tree/v1.0.0) (2018-09-18)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-logger/compare/v0.0.2...v1.0.0)

* **Essentially no client-relevant changes**. The purpose of this release is to get into the 1.x space, so that semantic versioning works correctly -- as [it deliberately does not in the 0.x space](https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/221).
* Use `eslint-config-stripes` to provide base for ESLint rules.
* Add [Jenkins support](Jenkinsfile), including a no-op `yarn test` rule.
* Add boilerplate: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, [Additional information section](README.md#additional-information).
* Add table of contents to [`README`](README.md).
* Fix some documentation typos.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-logger/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2)

## [0.0.1](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-logger/tree/v0.0.1) (2017-03-02)
